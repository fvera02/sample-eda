# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

## What is the problem?
This project aims to understand the differences between customers who accept the driving coupon and those who do not.
It uses exploratory data analysis, statistical summarization, and data visuazliation to discern some findings.

## What is the data?
This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers people can choose from:

- **“Right away”**
- **“Later, before the coupon expires”**
- **“No, I do not want the coupon”**
